PROJECT: MALWARE DETECTOR
DATE: 09 NOV
TEAM: ash_virus

To compile the project and host the website, we used Flask to locally host it. The file index.html is the frontend
of the website which is responsible for the UI/UX and the upload file option. It accepts a file from the user and 
successfully sends it to the backend and stores it temporarily in a directory called uploads.

The file app.py is a code written in Python that handles the backend imports flask to host the website and uses the 
venv package to create a virtual environment. The backend file first hosts the website with the command "python app.py" and then accepts
a file from the user and stores it in 'uploads' and then invokes an API called VirusTotal gets a review of the uploaded file and then 
prints the response with flash messages on the website with the entire process taking less than 2-3 seconds 

We also created sample test files comprising of data that can be flagged as potential malware which is included in this repo called sample
