PROJECT : MALWARE DETECTOR
DATE    : 09 NOV
TEAM    : ash_virus

In order to compile the project and host the website , we used flask to locally host it . The file index.html is the frontend
of the website which basically is responsible for the UI/UX and the upload file option . It accepts a file from the user and 
succesfully sends it to the backend and stores it temporarily in a directory called uploads .

The file app.py is a code written in python which handles the backend and imports flask to host the website, and also uses the 
venv package to create a virtual environment. The backend file first hosts the website with the command "python app.py" and the accepts
a file from the user and stores it in 'uploads' and then invokes an api called VirusTotal and gets a review of the uploaded file and then 
prints the response with flash messages on the website with the entire process taking less than 2-3 seconds
